            Born and raised in Manchester, England, I moved to the States in
            2014 and spent a year living in North Carolina until I came to my
            senses and moved across the country to San Francisco. <br /><br />I
            used my 20s to explore my career options and find something I was
            truly passionate about. At 30 years old, I've finally settled on a
            direction I want to take in my life and am pursuing a career in web
            development.

          <h5>The things I've learned on my journey</h5>
          <div class="border border-secondary bg-white p-2 mt-2">
            <h6><strong>Hairdressing</strong> </h6>
            <p>In England, I was a fully trained and qualified unisex hair stylist.
              I studied for two years at Accrington & Rossendale College,
              completing level 2 and 3 qualifications with excellent grades. I went 
              on to work for 4 years in a small salon in my home town, before moving 
              to America, where all of my qualifications were not recognized.
            </p>
            <h6><strong>Hospitality</strong></h6>
            <p>
              After moving to America in 2014, I quickly found myself a job at a nearby 
              Hilton hotel as a front desk agent. I already had experience dealing with 
              people from my hairdressing job, and I picked up the Property Management 
              software with relative ease. 6 months later, I moved to San Francisco and 
              struggled finding a hotel that would hire me with so little experience.
            </p>
            <h6><strong>Driving</strong></h6>
            <p>
              My next couple of jobs were centered around my driving skills. I was a 
              Pickup and Delivery Specialist for Shift, then I moved on to driving for 
              Lyft for 6 months. It was during my time with Lyft that I found the job I'd 
              stick with for the next 4 years.
            </p>
            <h6><strong>Warehouse Management & Training</strong></h6>
            <p>
              I started working for Omni Projects Inc. around September 2016. I started as 
              a delivery driver, but quickly worked my way up the ranks to Shift Lead. 
              After some time in this role, I took on additional responsibilities as the 
              lead trainer. Working at a startup where all training was 'tribal knowledge', 
              it was my responsibility to create documentation for processes and procedures 
              for each department within the warehouse, and then create and implement a 
              training program to ensure reliable training of new hires. 
              <br>
              <br> 
              I learned a lot about management, warehouse operations, training, and how to 
              properly load, unload, and drive a transit van during my time with Omni.
            </p>
            <h6><strong>Full Stack Web Development</strong></h6>
            <p>
              I am currently attending UC Berkeley Extension's part time full stack web 
              development course. I have become competent with 
              <ul>
                <li>HTML5</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>jQuery</li>
                <li>AJAX</li>
                <li>nodejs</li>
              </ul>

            When I'm not at my computer writing code, I'm either out riding my
            motorcycle or playing video games! <br /><br />I like to play games
            from varying genres, and often find myself thinking about how the
            code that makes a certain feature work might have been written.<br /><br />I
            ride a 2016 Honda CTX 700 - a touring/cruiser hybrid - and love
            going for long rides. The longest ride I've done so far is San
            Francisco to Portland OR, and back. I'd love to get a bigger bike
            that is more aimed at touring and take some time to travel the
            country.

              me or find a career at my business. Seeing as how I have a contact
              page, and I don't own a business, here are some links to a few of
              my favorite games. Some are online Flash games, others are on
              platforms like Steam, Epic, or Origin.
